# React-Portfolio-C12
University of Richmond - Code Challenge 12 - Project Portfolio in React
Created By: "Brad Webster" - in collaboration with edX Coding Bootcamp
## Description:
I was motivated to create a portfolio for myself to display all the coding projects I have completed so far. I wanted a centralized location for my work that was easily accessible for future employers, friends, family, and the internet in general. It would be difficult for these people to run my individual projects, because they are spread out in different repos with different coding languages and frameworks. Therefore having a simple display and description helps give the viewer a quick and easy way to assess my skills and projects. Building this portfolio has taught me mostly about React JS, live rendering, hooks, use effects and routing.
